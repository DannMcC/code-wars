You need to implement a function that applies the standard fizz buzz test:
*If a number is divisible by 3, return `Fizz`
*If it is divisible by 5, return `Buzz`
*If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, return `FizzBuzz`
*If it is not divisible by 3 or 5, return the number itself

However, when making the function, you cannot use `if` (meaning `else` is also not an option).
